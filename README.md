## Getting Started

First, run the frontend server:

```bash
npm i & npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the frontend page.

- Once that has started, click on the Choose file button to import the candata file. 

- Once imported go to: 

```bash
dotnet build Backend/can_bus can_bus.csproj 
```
- then when that has been built the output file will be available for download back on the frontend 

Enjoy!
